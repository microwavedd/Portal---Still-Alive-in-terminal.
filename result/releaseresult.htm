        Portal- Credit songs in your terminal. (Done in python)

    <h3 id="Explication">
        Welp, this is what I've been working for three days now, and seems pretty good
        <br />for a first independent project.
    </h3>
    <h4>
        In this project you will find:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A cover of your terminal "singing" the "Still Alive" portal credits song (Work in progress)
            </li>
            <li>
                Posibly in the future some more portal shitposty things.
            </li>
            <li>
                A png of Wheatley Crab (In the main folder hehehehe)
            </li>
            <li>
                The songs translated to other languagues, including German, Spanish and Italian. (Even more if you are willing to do so!)
            </li>
        </ul>
