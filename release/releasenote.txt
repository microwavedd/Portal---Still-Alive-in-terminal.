Aight, so quick recap of everything in this repo.

Folders:
main - Where the backbone and most scripts reside.
release - where this text file is (hi!) and where the final file, that you must drop into cmd resides.
result - an html file where I made a eeny weeny website that redirects you to the video uploaded with release, that showcases how the project should work.

Files:
asiis.py - Where every ascii art is stored in a function, stored in a function to not have to import every one manually. EFFICIENCE IS KEY. Also, calling the function directly from the print function and not storing it in a list is pretty neat.
