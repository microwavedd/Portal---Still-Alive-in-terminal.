Aight, so quick recap of everything in this repo.

[Folders]:
main - Where the backbone and most scripts reside.
release - where this text file is (hi!) and where the final file, that you must drop into cmd resides.
result - an html file where I made a eeny weeny website that redirects you to the video uploaded with release, that showcases how the project should work.

[Files]:
asiis.py - Where every ascii art is stored in a function, stored in a function to not have to import every one manually. EFFICIENCE IS KEY.
asciispace.py - Where every ascii is told to appear on screen for a certain time, on a certain moment.
broom.py - Function that erases everything written in the terminal 'til then.
song.py - A function containing a list with every single line of the "Still alive" song.
songpace.py - The file that controls when and for how much time every line is displayed in the terminal.
StillAlive.mp3 - The Songâ„¢ 
typewriter.py - Function that controls the display of strings, making the style of these seem as if someone were writing them while you watch.
wheatleycrab.png - hehehehehehe
sneekypeeky.lua - A sneak peek of future updates of this repo.

stillalive.py - The executer of the project. Dragging it to the terminal ignites the song.

portalstyle.css - Styling for the HTML spam file.
releaseresult.htm - File to show some info about the project and its future, apart from a link to the YT video where the project is shown working.
